          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final day of week 5, phase 0 of DevBootcamp and so far I have had 10 pairing sessions. These sessions have had a lot of variation in terms of their effectiveness and how much I have enjoyed them.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a couple programming classes in the spring, primarily a Java course, and we spent a lot of our time working together to solve the problems. Between that experience, and my experience in pairing with DBC, I have found that pairing is vastly more beneficial to learning and problem solving than working alone.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to have a strong line of communication between a pair to really get the benefits of talking through possible solutions. In the pairing sessions I have had, those in which we were both chatting back and forth about the problem and possible ways to solve it, were not only the most productive, but I also learned more.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a long string of great pairs, and wasn&#39;t sure what would define a <em>bad</em> pairing session, that is, until I had one. What made it a negative experience was that the whole time I felt that my opinions were not being considered, and that I was being looked down upon. I could go on about the one more negative experience, but really what I took from it was that the pair relationship has to be one of respect and support. You need to make your pair feel respected so they are comfortable sharing their views and ideas with you, and really disrespect can be really distracting from the goal of the challenge. A good pair is supportive by giving honest, but <em>respectful</em>, real time feedback, because this is how you really talk through a challenge together. You also need to support them but providing them with any tricks you more efficient methods you may know, or by explaining confusing parts so that you are both on the same page technically.

          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback:
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting all the feedback, I wish more that I knew who wrote each piece. Some bits of information provided in feedback are more helpful when one can apply those inputs to your experience too, so you can analyze their points from your point of view. Leaving it anonymous just seems to be keeping you from getting the most out of a piece of feedback. The less helpful feedbacks tend to but what I think are the earlier ones, where we are all practicing giving effective feedback. Most feedback provides me with at least some type of useful information for improving my mind set and pairing skills. I wish the feedbackinator would let me know who I have written feedback for since after a long day of challenges and pairing, I have had 3 pairs in a day before, I can&#39;t quite remember who I wrote feedback for and who I didn&#39;t. It would be very helpful to know who I wrote it for!
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pairing is great, especially with us all working remotely, it helps us build relationships and pairing skills for when the on campus time starts.  Feedback is great, but hopefully we can get to the point where we will be able to communicate this information in person, without using the anonymous feedbackinator. I would prefer to hear from the pair partner directly, so I can reflect more effectively on how to improve.
