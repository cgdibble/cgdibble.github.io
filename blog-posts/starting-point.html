      <h3>My Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This challenge really tested my (/our) understanding of HTML and CSS. It took a lot of experimentation to get certain items to be placed where we wanted, especially when it came to getting the nav bar items above the picture and listed horizontally.  It was really good practice though, and not just HTML/CSS but also DevTools.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never did quite get the nav bar to be centered over the picture and text, and we spent at least 30 minutes fiddling with different elements and methods for aligning. Giving it margins on the left and right set to auto left the centered about 2/3s over to the right side of the page, while trying to simply center the div didn’t actually center it. We really had a tough time with it, but at least we did not get angry and frustrated, we pressed on.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not feel wholly prepared for this challenge after going through all the materials given, but it did make for a great way to learn it through experimentation. We actually didn’t even use media queries (now that I re-read the directions at the top of release2), so that is probably what the issue was. Hopefully we can go back and do some media queries in hopes of fixing our issues.
