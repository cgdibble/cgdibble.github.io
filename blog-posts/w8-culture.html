          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most relevant emotional conflict is the one I had with my fiancée about pursuing software development. I had left my job as a forester with CALFIRE and wanted to sign up for some community college classes in a couple languages to see if it was the right step. Around that time she had been accepted as an intern for, what is basically a dream job in San Diego. We had and still have spent way too much time separated, and this time we had some what of a choice. I knew that I wanted to pursue DBC and since that wasn’t an option from San Diego we had to decide to be apart for four months. I got a weekend visit in there part way through at least.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ended up having to discuss our life goals in more depth than before, and our short and long term goals. This allowed us to see each others visions for the future and how to work around these rough patches. It would have been better to illustrate our goals ahead of time, instead of waiting until the defining moment. In the end our actions resolved the situation very effectively.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This just taught me to have a more open line of communication about pretty much everything, especially life goals and desires/dreams. This will make for a smoother transition when the necessary steps to accomplish those things comes.
