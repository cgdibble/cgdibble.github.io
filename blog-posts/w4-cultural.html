          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the current squabbles going on around the tech world is that between PlayStation and Xbox in the form of the &#34;console-wars.&#34; Both companies are aggressively trying to give the &#39;ol 1-2 punch and it is getting ridiculous. There is a big difference between healthy competition, and hopes of destroying your opponent.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up there has always been a sort of rift between the console companies and their clientele, sort of like Ford and Chevy truck owners, they just can&#39;t seem to get along. I started with a Ninetendo 64, then PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox360. All the systems are fantastic in their own rights, but in the end I am a tried and true Xbox 360 guy.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain things I really don&#39;t like about the PlayStation consoles, mostly interface and that dang controller.  I always hated the controller, from the days of the original PlayStation I have disliked it. The Xbox just fits the hands so much more, but I digress. What really is the problem here, is that it is ok to prefer a different system, and for the most part arguing over their quantifiable differences is useless because in the end, someone who wants an Xbox will get one, and the same for PlayStation (and other consoles of course, but I am just going to reference the leading ones).
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect that has been said to have kept consoles alive is console exclusive content and games. The big name here is Halo, and all its sequels. I love Halo, and it is the reason why I got an Xbox, and why I will probably get an Xbox One instead of the PS4. The thing is though, even when I had a PS3 and an Xbox360 at the same time, I could play one or the other, I almost never played the PS3, I even gave it to my brother because it got no use. This wasn&#39;t because I only played Halo anytime I gamed, in fact I have a pretty good collection of games, and at the time both consoles had a similarly sized selection on my shelf, but it was just the experience was different on Xbox and I preferred it. These console wars are ridiculous because they are putting in so much time, money and effort in to winning people over, yet I am curious how many people actually stand on the fence when a new generation of consoles comes out. There are certain aspects of the PS4 that draw me, but in the end it is the same exact scenario with the XBONE.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feels like a rambling, and probably is, but what I would love to see from the big names on console gaming is more dedication to enhancing the experience of current users instead of trying to dangle goodies in front of the competitions customers trying to lure them over. Maybe this is actually happening and I am just seeing the goodie dangling, but as of right now, I am keeping my 360 until it dies in the hopes of getting backwards compatibility for all my 360 games to be used on the Xbox One.
