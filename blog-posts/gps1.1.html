            <h4>What is pair programming?</h4><p></p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Pair programming is when you are working together to create a single project with someone else.
            You are both working on the same code.</p>

            <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
            </p>
            <p></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Phase-0, it is important to not only code together, but to also get to know your fellow boots.
            It is great for improving your communcation skills and getting each other out of our comfort zones.

            <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver focuses on the task at hand and translates what the navigator says into code, while the navigator is the one who is talking through the process.
            This doesn't mean the driver is silent -- there should be open communication between the two of them.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, I have had great experiences in pairing sessions. It is really beneficial to interact with fellow boots and to get to know each other. It also really helps in the learning process to work together, and I find myself coming away with new tricks in HTML/CSS each time. As a GPS vs regular pairing session, this seemed to be more of the later. It probably was due to the nature of the material, and that it was the end of the week so we had pretty much gotten the hang of these things throughout the weeks challenges. But hey, it also could have been how well we were working together as a pair. The instructor was very good at making comments either through audio or the comment box to drive us in the right direction, and I think we received those nudges well.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing wireframes via group session was a bit strange, as we hand drew it, but it made for a light and comical way to start the session. This felt like another standard pair session, with tid bits of very helpful and very interesting information thrown it, which is essentially exactly how I would want a GPS to go, so, right on.
