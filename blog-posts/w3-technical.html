           Technical Blog: Why is JavaScript so Popular?
        </p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starters, JavaScript is in not related to Java at all, they are two entirely different languages, so we can thank who ever named JavaScript for that confusion. JavaScript is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that was first released in 1995. It was first brought into existence as a means of adding programs to browsers, specifically Netscape Navigator.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript has characteristics that allow it to be more comfortable to use for beginners, but because of this it is not stingy on what it allows. Being more liberal about what you can make in JavaScript also makes it more difficult to debug and find problems in your code.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being an object-oriented language is great, it allows us to create objects that store information and to have much more workable code. Before object-oriented programming we were stuck with the linear flow stuff, so a program would run the code top to bottom and be done. JavaScript allows us to bring object-oriented programming to our browsers, and all major browsers run JavaScript.
