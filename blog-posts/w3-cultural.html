          In doing the Gregorc Thinking style test, it turns out I am an Abstract Random, which makes a lot of sense. I did a little research into what that really meant, and was pretty surprised at how accurately it reflected my personality. Specifcally when I read this excerpt <a href="http://child-1st.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/05/the-abstract-random-learning-style.html">online</a>:

          &#34;Heightened instincts and intuition make the AR gifted at reading signals that to others might be invisible. In addition, the AR is strongly motivated by the needs of others. Not just sensing them, but doing something about them. Innocuous questions such as &#34;Which show do you want to watch?&#34; or &#34;Which game shall we play?&#34; or &#34;What shall we have for dinner tonight?&#34; often throw the AR into what looks like indecision (even though the AR knows clearly what he wants) because in making the choice, the AR worries that he will be depriving his companions of what they want!&#34;

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a big &#34;Woah! That&#39;s me!&#34; moment. I am the type of person that has trouble picking music on the radio when in the car with others because I don&#39;t know how the others will feel about it, because after all I can pretty much be happy with anything myself. If there is a debate about what to do in a given evening, then I am trying hard to make sure the others involved are pleased with the decision, but at the same time dislike wasting time with indecision.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this experience at DevBootcamp approaches the end of the third week of Phase-0, I have been pushed out of my comfort zone routinely. Right now, my biggest struggle is probably with the sharing of these blogs, the use of twitter, and in general exposing my work and weaknesses to everyone. I have a hard time posting all my work because I have this feeling of &#34;Who cares? If they want to see it then we can talk about it and I will share.&#34; every time, but that is starting to dissipate. This is very indicative of the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Abstract Random</a> mind such as mine, since difficulty with criticism, competition and explaining feelings are all weaknesses of the AR, and all of these things are tested with the blog posts and sharing them. When working through the curriculum for DBC I came across the part where we <em>had</em> to create a <a href="https://twitter.com/cgdibble">Twitter</a> account, and I will be honest, I was pissed&#8230;at first. While I still have similar feelings about Twitter, I at least have come to the understanding that this is me being forced out of my comfort zone (and boy, that comfort zone is comfy!), and putting my work out there for all to see. So, while I may not be using Twitter to post what kind of dinner I made, or me dumping ice water on my head, I am still using it to get more comfortable with exposing myself to the criticism of others, a weakness for us ARs. Now, I may still moan and groan when the final release for the current challenge I am working on is to post my work to Twitter, I am still excited because I am getting out there and growing as a person despite how uncomfortable it is outside of my comfy zone, which is basically sponsored by lay-z-boy.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as far as <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth versus fixed mindset</a> I think it just darned well depends what aspect of me we are talking about. I always have felt that we can change who we are, but only to a degree. For example, my parents always say the mannerisms and behaviors we expressed as young children still exist almost identically today, yet here I am, feeling and seeming like a totally different (hopefully more mature) person. There are certain parts of us that are just are the way they are, and others that are up for change. I believe that I have been an abstract random since day one, which isn&#39;t to say that that can&#39;t change, but based on the data presented, it seems unlikely.  I have always had trouble sitting in class rooms listening to lectures, and was an ADD/ADHD diagnosed kid, but that all changed. The fact was, I couldn&#39;t stand that learning environment, so devoid of anything interesting or engaging. I was taking good ol prescription drugs for this diagnosis, and I took them for four years (sophomore year of high school to sophomore year in college). The decision to stop was mine and mine alone, I realized that upon finding something that did interest me and did engage me, I didn&#39;t need that crap anymore. That year in college I had declared my major in Forestry at Cal, a truly interesting topic that certainly gets you out of the class room a bit. At that point, I didn&#39;t need 60mg of Ritalin a morning to make me give a damn, I just had to go to class. That seems an awful lot like a ranting tangent but hey, I just want to illustrate that the growth was experienced in that I thought I had a fixed learning style when I started taking the drugs, and realized that that was false and that my mind was ready to grow, and it still is, so bring it on DevBootcamp.
