          Welcome, if this is your first time here then hopefully it won't be your last, as this site is going to be changing a lot in the coming months, and it is something we should all be excited about. Soon enough this site will be far more interesting and include significantly more content, all for your browsing pleasure. Please, if you are unimpressed, come back in a little while and see what has happened here, hopefully it doesn't get ugly, lets cross our fingers it becomes something amazing.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to cover a little bit more about myself. I am currently in the preparatory phase (Phase-0) of <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DevBootcamp</a>. DevBootcamp? Why DevBootcamp is a nine week, ultra-intense, hands-on web development school that builds more than just your programming prowess. Even early on, we are getting heavy doses of &quot;get your butt out of your comfort zone,&quot; with regards to both our technical and social skills. We have been pairing remotely on &quot;challenges,&quot; and all communicate via one big Google+ community. The end of week two is drawing to a close and I already feel as if I know many of my cohort-mates, just through internet correspondence.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little journey of mine does not start here though. I went to Berkeley and got a BS in Forestry and Natural Resources, and got a seasonal job with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE. I was working on Jackson Demonstration State Forest out of Fort Bragg, CA. The nine month season had me preparing hundreds of acres for harvest, and my work included all the aspects a harvest plan requires, including plenty of steep hills, poison oak, and mosquitoes. My seasonal position ended in December of 2013, and in the months leading up to its end I had been contemplating various ideas about incorporating technology into forestry practices. Well, it turns out the off season for that job was the perfect amount of time to attend a semester of classes at a community college. I ended up taking Intro Java, Access Database Design, and Intro C++.  Not too long into the semester I realized that I loved programming, and that I had chosen a new path.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, I had heard about DevBootcamp, but thought that I had no where near the technical skills to be successful, or even be competitive in applying. Another factor that held me back was not knowing if software engineering was something I could become passionate about. Luckily, that semester of classes really changed my mind. I started applying a few months in, and managed to get an interview. The interview went well, and that day (talk about turn around time) they let me know that I got in! I have been counting the days until the start since.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here I am, learning HTML/CSS and trying to absorb as much information as fast as possible, but being sure to absorb it with full understanding and clarity.
