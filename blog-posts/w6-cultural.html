          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been the &#34;victim&#34; of stereotype threat. It is dumb that it happens and not to mention frustrating. If it happens such that I get worked up over it, I&#39;m not mad or hurt because of what they said, it is more that they are ignorant enough to have said it. But what can you do? Some people are naive and believe that stereotypes should be applied to every person of a demographic. The thing is, none of them should be applied to any individual of a demographic because in the end you have to get to know someone, who they are, where they come from, what they have experienced in life, to really know a person. Stereotypes can&#39;t answer any of those questions for you. In the end, educating people who apply these stereotype threats is the only way, you have to rise above and be the better person. Teach them what it is to be you, and how you accomplished it, tear down the stereotypical caricature they constructed over you and help them understand who <em>you</em> are, not the &#34;you&#34; they expected you to be.        <!-- ENTER POST HERE -->
