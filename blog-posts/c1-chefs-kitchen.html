                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy of kitchen vs restaurant really is awesome. It is the perfect example of the type of mindset that is needed for DevBootcamp and development in general. I can definitely relate to his talk about fears and expectations in the Phase-0 approach to DBC. My own feelings have oscillated some, as I have moments that I fear inadequacy, and others where I wonder if it will be enough.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue to be impressed with the mindsets of both my fellow boots, and the instructors at DBC. Everyone emits a strong sense of individuality and desire to achieve, yet the urge to work together creates strong working relationships and skill building. I really am looking forward to working and learning in this environment, and expect it will exceed my expectations. Progressing through Phase-0 is only reinforcing my excitement to be in this program, but there is of course the ever present jitters about being in such a competitive program will remain!
