          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to asking the correct questions, you have to have some sort of background or base line knowledge to really be successful. It can generally be pretty obvious if a person is either asking a question out of laziness, or genuine confusion and interest. I have taken a notice of this a lot when I browse and participate in a variety of online forums. These forums are topic specific, and a wealth of information can be found among the users.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first started on the forums, it is typically to learn more about the topic. Each time I look into a new topic though, I find I am not asking questions, I am researching and reading the topics already available. When ever I have jumped the gun and asked a question before really knowing what was going on, it <em>always</em> ends up being a simple answer I should have gone and found myself. These premature questions are often out of laziness too, and come from not wanting to do the research myself.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other users responses make it very obvious if you are asking a good question or not, simply out of the detail and level of interest the response conveys. This has shown me that in my own mind, a good question will come up, and I will actively search for an answer, and only then will I commit my question to the fellow forum users.  This way, it is a true and honest question, that likely is not easily answered because if it was, my research before asking would have done so.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you gain a knowledge base on a topic, any topic, you can start to ask the <em>right</em> questions. For instance, if you had a job interview with a company, would you show up and ask “What does this company do?” or would you do research before hand on them so you had a base level of knowledge from which to ask meaningful questions about them? Hopefully the latter. You also might not go to a comic book convention and ask around about who Stan Lee is, at least maybe you wouldn’t ask seriously.
