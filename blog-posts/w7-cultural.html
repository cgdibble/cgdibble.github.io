          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The values I selected for myself are:
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplishment, enthusiasm, growth, leadership, meaningful work,  reputation., responsibility
          <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth:
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth is very important for me to be happy, proud and satisfied. Without growth, you are stagnant and are not gaining anything. I am the type of person who needs to be challenged and to learn to be truly enjoying myself, and with out growth I can get pretty down in the pits.
          <ul>
            <li>Accomplishment: 5</li>
            <li>Enthusiasm: 5</li>
            <li>Growth: 5</li>
            <li>Leadership: 5</li>
            <li>Meaningful work: 5</li>
            <li>Reputation: 5</li>
            <li>Responsibility: 5</li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always try to live up to these values, because these are what define me and who I am at the core.  There are certainly times in which my focus wanes, and those are the times when I get down in life. To get myself out of a bad spot, the best thing for me to do is to revert back to these core values.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time some one asked me for advice was about what type of keyboard they should get.  I suppose people don’t ask me for advice very often, or maybe when they do I just don’t recognize it as such.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These values are what defend me from stereotype threat. It happens, yeah, but because of my focus on these values it is a non-issue for me. If I am feeling down I will have to revert back to these values, just as before.
