                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the current squabbles going on around the tech world is that between PlayStation and Xbox in the form of the &#34;console-wars.&#34; Both companies are aggressively trying to give the &#39;ol 1-2 punch and it is getting ridiculous. There is a big difference between healthy competition, and hopes of destroying your opponent.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up there has always been a sort of rift between the console companies and their clientele, sort of like Ford and Chevy truck owners, they just can&#39;t seem to get along. I started with a Ninetendo 64, then PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox360. All the systems are fantastic in their own rights, but in the end I am a tried and true Xbox 360 guy.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain things I really don&#39;t like about the PlayStation consoles, mostly interface and that dang controller.  I always hated the controller, from the days of the original PlayStation I have disliked it. The Xbox just fits the hands so much more, but I digress. What really is the problem here, is that it is ok to prefer a different system, and for the most part arguing over their quantifiable differences is useless because in the end, someone who wants an Xbox will get one, and the same for PlayStation (and other consoles of course, but I am just going to reference the leading ones).
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect that has been said to have kept consoles alive is console exclusive content and games. The big name here is Halo, and all its sequels. I love Halo, and it is the reason why I got an Xbox, and why I will probably get an Xbox One instead of the PS4. The thing is though, even when I had a PS3 and an Xbox360 at the same time, I could play one or the other, I almost never played the PS3, I even gave it to my brother because it got no use. This wasn&#39;t because I only played Halo anytime I gamed, in fact I have a pretty good collection of games, and at the time both consoles had a similarly sized selection on my shelf, but it was just the experience was different on Xbox and I preferred it. These console wars are ridiculous because they are putting in so much time, money and effort in to winning people over, yet I am curious how many people actually stand on the fence when a new generation of consoles comes out. There are certain aspects of the PS4 that draw me, but in the end it is the same exact scenario with the XBONE.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feels like a rambling, and probably is, but what I would love to see from the big names on console gaming is more dedication to enhancing the experience of current users instead of trying to dangle goodies in front of the competitions customers trying to lure them over. Maybe this is actually happening and I am just seeing the goodie dangling, but as of right now, I am keeping my 360 until it dies in the hopes of getting backwards compatibility for all my 360 games to be used on the Xbox One.

                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, we have been working a lot with hashes and arrays in Ruby. Hashes are very new to me, and determining which data structure is appropriate in what scenario takes some getting used to.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html">array</a> can be as simple as a list of numbers, or it can be as complicated as lists of lists of lists of objects (that sounds overly complicated, right?). To reference a value in an array, you need to use that values index. Array indices start from 0, so the first item in an array will always have an index of 0, and the last element in an array will have an index of array.length &ndash; 1. The #length might look new to you, and if it does, it is a method that returns the length of whatever array you call it on. Arrays can be great for storing things like a list of words to be randomly selected for a game of hang-man, or the details of a person&#39;s address.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html">Hashes</a> are buddies with arrays, but they can be used very differently. For one, hashes are not bound to strictly numerical indices like arrays, in fact, you can give a hash any index you want. To avoid confusion, hashes don&#39;t really use index, they call it a &#34;key.&#34;  Every key in a hash is matched with a certain value, thus getting us key/value pairs. You might want to store a list of all of your friends and their ages, so you would assign the key as the persons name, and the value as their age. From here you can see a myriad of methods associated with hashes that allow you to play with the data, with things like sorting, deleting and adding methods.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I have learned so far in choosing is that it depends. I am even curious if a hash that has values of arrays, maybe that works, that could be pretty useful if you wanted to pull a list of numbers associated with a certain key. Luckily, there is quite a bit of overlap in methods, and they don&#39;t change naming conventions all over the place for each class, so you have a lot of repeated methods. Hashes are very cool, and I am glad Ruby has them, as arrays can sometimes be tricky to deal with, at least in the scenarios in which a hash is best.

                    In doing the Gregorc Thinking style test, it turns out I am an Abstract Random, which makes a lot of sense. I did a little research into what that really meant, and was pretty surprised at how accurately it reflected my personality. Specifcally when I read this excerpt <a href="http://child-1st.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/05/the-abstract-random-learning-style.html">online</a>:
                    <br><br>
                    &#34;Heightened instincts and intuition make the AR gifted at reading signals that to others might be invisible. In addition, the AR is strongly motivated by the needs of others. Not just sensing them, but doing something about them. Innocuous questions such as &#34;Which show do you want to watch?&#34; or &#34;Which game shall we play?&#34; or &#34;What shall we have for dinner tonight?&#34; often throw the AR into what looks like indecision (even though the AR knows clearly what he wants) because in making the choice, the AR worries that he will be depriving his companions of what they want!&#34;
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a big &#34;Woah! That&#39;s me!&#34; moment. I am the type of person that has trouble picking music on the radio when in the car with others because I don&#39;t know how the others will feel about it, because after all I can pretty much be happy with anything myself. If there is a debate about what to do in a given evening, then I am trying hard to make sure the others involved are pleased with the decision, but at the same time dislike wasting time with indecision.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this experience at DevBootcamp approaches the end of the third week of Phase-0, I have been pushed out of my comfort zone routinely. Right now, my biggest struggle is probably with the sharing of these blogs, the use of twitter, and in general exposing my work and weaknesses to everyone. I have a hard time posting all my work because I have this feeling of &#34;Who cares? If they want to see it then we can talk about it and I will share.&#34; every time, but that is starting to dissipate. This is very indicative of the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Abstract Random</a> mind such as mine, since difficulty with criticism, competition and explaining feelings are all weaknesses of the AR, and all of these things are tested with the blog posts and sharing them. When working through the curriculum for DBC I came across the part where we <em>had</em> to create a <a href="https://twitter.com/cgdibble">Twitter</a> account, and I will be honest, I was pissed&#8230;at first. While I still have similar feelings about Twitter, I at least have come to the understanding that this is me being forced out of my comfort zone (and boy, that comfort zone is comfy!), and putting my work out there for all to see. So, while I may not be using Twitter to post what kind of dinner I made, or me dumping ice water on my head, I am still using it to get more comfortable with exposing myself to the criticism of others, a weakness for us ARs. Now, I may still moan and groan when the final release for the current challenge I am working on is to post my work to Twitter, I am still excited because I am getting out there and growing as a person despite how uncomfortable it is outside of my comfy zone, which is basically sponsored by lay-z-boy.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as far as <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth versus fixed mindset</a> I think it just darned well depends what aspect of me we are talking about. I always have felt that we can change who we are, but only to a degree. For example, my parents always say the mannerisms and behaviors we expressed as young children still exist almost identically today, yet here I am, feeling and seeming like a totally different (hopefully more mature) person. There are certain parts of us that are just are the way they are, and others that are up for change. I believe that I have been an abstract random since day one, which isn&#39;t to say that that can&#39;t change, but based on the data presented, it seems unlikely.  I have always had trouble sitting in class rooms listening to lectures, and was an ADD/ADHD diagnosed kid, but that all changed. The fact was, I couldn&#39;t stand that learning environment, so devoid of anything interesting or engaging. I was taking good ol prescription drugs for this diagnosis, and I took them for four years (sophomore year of high school to sophomore year in college). The decision to stop was mine and mine alone, I realized that upon finding something that did interest me and did engage me, I didn&#39;t need that crap anymore. That year in college I had declared my major in Forestry at Cal, a truly interesting topic that certainly gets you out of the class room a bit. At that point, I didn&#39;t need 60mg of Ritalin a morning to make me give a damn, I just had to go to class. That seems an awful lot like a ranting tangent but hey, I just want to illustrate that the growth was experienced in that I thought I had a fixed learning style when I started taking the drugs, and realized that that was false and that my mind was ready to grow, and it still is, so bring it on DevBootcamp.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starters, JavaScript is in not related to Java at all, they are two entirely different languages, so we can thank who ever named JavaScript for that confusion. JavaScript is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that was first released in 1995. It was first brought into existence as a means of adding programs to browsers, specifically Netscape Navigator.
                    <br><br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript has characteristics that allow it to be more comfortable to use for beginners, but because of this it is not stingy on what it allows. Being more liberal about what you can make in JavaScript also makes it more difficult to debug and find problems in your code.
                  <br><br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being an object-oriented language is great, it allows us to create objects that store information and to have much more workable code. Before object-oriented programming we were stuck with the linear flow stuff, so a program would run the code top to bottom and be done. JavaScript allows us to bring object-oriented programming to our browsers, and all major browsers run JavaScript.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this weeks technical blog, the topic is CSS concepts and some differences between them.We will start with some basic concepts: Margin, Border, and Padding. These three things can be confusing to grasp at first as they are mostly just slightly different. I like to think about it like this; Imagine you are looking at a small town from a birds eye view, such that you can see all the buildings in the town. Those buildings represent elements on your website. The padding of an element is how much space is added inside the element. For example, the padding in our town example would be the space within a building that a person can roam. A small building without much space would be an element with only a little bit of padding, while large buildings would have lots of padding. Or you can think of it being the amount of yard/property a house has around before butting up against the next piece of property (element).
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Border is basically the outline of your elements. The house elements on our town website all have walls, and those walls outline the structure. Some structures like sheds might have thin walls (borders), while others might have thick ones.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margin is the amount of space outside of one elements border, that separates it from the next element. Imagine if people really disliked their neighbors, and could add fifty feet of no-mans-land space between their property and their neighbors. That would be adding a margin between their two elements.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In CSS there are classes and ids. These handy tools allow you to be more specific about how you want certain elements styled, and to do it from your CSS document. Ids can only be used on one element on a page, and are designated with a # before the name of the id ( #idName).
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes can be applied to any number of elements, including elements with ids already. Elements can also have multiple classes each, you can have 5 elements with an id and 4 classes each assigned to it if you wanted, as long as it was only one id. Classes are denoted by a period at the start of the name, so: .className would be your syntax in your stylesheet. You can specify that classes only apply to certain elements by doing something like: div.className{}. Below you can see the class that is used to set up the table this blog is in. Each blog post is in its own table, therefore it is best to make this a class so that I can assign it to each blog post table.
                    <br>
                    <img src="../imgs/w2-technical-classexample.png">
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In positioning elements, you can use: absolute, fixed and relative. Absolute positions the element relative to its first positioned ancestor element. Fixed positions the element relative to the browser window. Relative positions the element relative to its normal position. So, a relative position with left:20 will add 20 pixels to the elements left position.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The display property has two big values: inline and inline-block, as well as a long list of other possible values. Inline block displays the elements without starting a new line. So if you have a div that has a ul in it, if you do inline block, the list items will appear in a row. Using inline block allows you to form elements inline (such as with just using inline). The difference is that you get to treat it like a block in that you can still set width/height, margins and padding. This would cause a list of items to be in their own little boxes (blocks), while still being horizontally listed.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy of kitchen vs restaurant really is awesome. It is the perfect example of the type of mindset that is needed for DevBootcamp and development in general. I can definitely relate to his talk about fears and expectations in the Phase-0 approach to DBC. My own feelings have oscillated some, as I have moments that I fear inadequacy, and others where I wonder if it will be enough.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue to be impressed with the mindsets of both my fellow boots, and the instructors at DBC. Everyone emits a strong sense of individuality and desire to achieve, yet the urge to work together creates strong working relationships and skill building. I really am looking forward to working and learning in this environment, and expect it will exceed my expectations. Progressing through Phase-0 is only reinforcing my excitement to be in this program, but there is of course the ever present jitters about being in such a competitive program will remain!

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my honorary first blog post, commemorating my first week of phase-0 at DevBootcamp, the topic is about my three favorite websites and the pros and cons of each. Seeing as the future will bring a lot of web development, this could be an important exercise that will be revisited in the future. Now, these three sites are going to be in no particular order. I am not sure I could really boil it down to a top three, there are just too many factors.
                    <br><br>
                    My first site is going to be <a href="http://www.polygon.com/">Polygon</a>:
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polygon is a site that is dedicated to gaming and the culture that thrives on gaming.  Having a gaming news site really is a niche, and it provides more richer content than an online news site that tries to cover all topics. One of the cool things I love about this site is that it doesn&rsquo;t regurgitate old articles just because something in the archive got a few clicks, the content is new and always flowing.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Polygon from a distance, you are drawn to the articles, and pretty much every article has a corresponding image to help draw you in. The header of the site is a grid of the top/newest articles, featuring 4 or 5 different options. These options aren&rsquo;t just your basic text link, they are awesome and curious photos with the article title overlaid. These links are great because they give you more to base your choice to click on other than just the wording of the title.
                    <br><br>
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The navigation bar allows you to quickly and efficiently narrow down the topics you want covered.  You can even choose what gaming system you want to focus on, or video reviews of games of all types. The nav bar remains in place no matter where on the site you are, and to make it easier, Polygon will suggest related articles at the bottom of articles you read.
                    <br><br>
                    5 adjectives about the website visually: organized, attractive,  themed,  divided, flowing
                    <br><br>
                    5 adjectives to describe content, focus and purpose: gaming, broad-spectrum,  informative, dedicated,  well-stocked.
                    <br><br>
                    Some adjectives that I feel after being on the site for a while: bored (Well, I can only read about gaming news for so long), anxious (new games coming out!),  entertained.
                    <br><br>
                    Polygon is also a branch of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> which is the more generalized tech world news site, which has many of the same qualities as Polygon does.
                    <br><br>
                    Next we have <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home-page">Wall Street Journal</a>:
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall  Street Journal does a good job of incorporating technology into the timeless newspaper style layout.  At a glance your eyes are drawn to the most prominent articles, the front pagers.  The most prominent feature on the site is the WSJ logo, it seems to pop out too much in its box in the top left corner.  It would look better with a centered and written out title, as opposed to the current large text &ldquo;WSJ.&rdquo;
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WSJ takes a large amount of content in the form of news articles and links, and organizes it into categories. Featured content gets the more prominent locations and visuals, while other content is relegated to text links on the margins.  Their layout allows the less prominent content to still be quite visible and accessible.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a site that really is loaded with content, and is re-loaded every day, the navigation lends itself to easy use. The navigation bar has a well thought out selection of topics to choose from to narrow your search for interesting articles.
                    <br><br>
                    5 adjectives to describe the site visually: loaded, organized,  compartmentalized, relevant, intuitive
                    <br><br>
                    5 adjectives to describe content, focus and purpose: informative, detailed,  comprehensive, current, dedicated.
                    <br><br>
                    Some adjectives describing how I feel after some time on the site: educated, informed, overwhelmed.
                   <br><br>
                    My final choice is going to have to be <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>:
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMDb is a website dedicated to information on television entertainment. This site gives a wealth of information for each and every move, tv show, or actor/actress I have ever looked up, and proves to be quite comprehensive.  If you ever have one of those &ldquo;Oh who was that guy in that movie that one time?&rdquo; moments, IMDb is the place to look.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homepage offers interesting facts and videos/graphics of recent or older media. I tend to not go straight to the homepage as I usually get to this site through a Google search of a movie or actor. What really is the essential part of the home page is the search bar, and it is the first thing your eye catches. The search function is very effective, and will yield specific results. From farther back, your eye tends to be moved to the different videos and images screaming for attention lower down on the page.
                    <br><br>
                    5 adjectives to describe the  site visually: media rich, focused, informative,  alluring, inquisitive.
                    <br><br>
                    5 adjectives to describe content, focus and purpose: specific, thorough, related, extensive, complete.
                    <br><br>
                    Some adjectives to describe how I feel after some time on the site: satisfied (Gotta love getting that movie trivia factoid answered), entertained.
