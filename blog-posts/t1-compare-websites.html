           <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my honorary first blog post, commemorating my first week of phase-0 at DevBootcamp, the topic is about my three favorite websites and the pros and cons of each. Seeing as the future will bring a lot of web development, this could be an important exercise that will be revisited in the future. Now, these three sites are going to be in no particular order. I am not sure I could really boil it down to a top three, there are just too many factors.
            <br><br>
            My first site is going to be <a href="http://www.polygon.com/">Polygon</a>:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polygon is a site that is dedicated to gaming and the culture that thrives on gaming.  Having a gaming news site really is a niche, and it provides more richer content than an online news site that tries to cover all topics. One of the cool things I love about this site is that it doesn&rsquo;t regurgitate old articles just because something in the archive got a few clicks, the content is new and always flowing.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Polygon from a distance, you are drawn to the articles, and pretty much every article has a corresponding image to help draw you in. The header of the site is a grid of the top/newest articles, featuring 4 or 5 different options. These options aren&rsquo;t just your basic text link, they are awesome and curious photos with the article title overlaid. These links are great because they give you more to base your choice to click on other than just the wording of the title.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The navigation bar allows you to quickly and efficiently narrow down the topics you want covered.  You can even choose what gaming system you want to focus on, or video reviews of games of all types. The nav bar remains in place no matter where on the site you are, and to make it easier, Polygon will suggest related articles at the bottom of articles you read.
            <br><br>
            5 adjectives about the website visually: organized, attractive,  themed,  divided, flowing
            <br><br>
            5 adjectives to describe content, focus and purpose: gaming, broad-spectrum,  informative, dedicated,  well-stocked.
            <br><br>
            Some adjectives that I feel after being on the site for a while: bored (Well, I can only read about gaming news for so long), anxious (new games coming out!),  entertained.
            <br><br>
            Polygon is also a branch of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> which is the more generalized tech world news site, which has many of the same qualities as Polygon does.
            <br><br>
            Next we have <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home-page">Wall Street Journal</a>:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall  Street Journal does a good job of incorporating technology into the timeless newspaper style layout.  At a glance your eyes are drawn to the most prominent articles, the front pagers.  The most prominent feature on the site is the WSJ logo, it seems to pop out too much in its box in the top left corner.  It would look better with a centered and written out title, as opposed to the current large text &ldquo;WSJ.&rdquo;
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WSJ takes a large amount of content in the form of news articles and links, and organizes it into categories. Featured content gets the more prominent locations and visuals, while other content is relegated to text links on the margins.  Their layout allows the less prominent content to still be quite visible and accessible.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a site that really is loaded with content, and is re-loaded every day, the navigation lends itself to easy use. The navigation bar has a well thought out selection of topics to choose from to narrow your search for interesting articles.
            <br><br>
            5 adjectives to describe the site visually: loaded, organized,  compartmentalized, relevant, intuitive
            <br><br>
            5 adjectives to describe content, focus and purpose: informative, detailed,  comprehensive, current, dedicated.
            <br><br>
            Some adjectives describing how I feel after some time on the site: educated, informed, overwhelmed.
            <br><br>
            My final choice is going to have to be <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMDb is a website dedicated to information on television entertainment. This site gives a wealth of information for each and every move, tv show, or actor/actress I have ever looked up, and proves to be quite comprehensive.  If you ever have one of those &ldquo;Oh who was that guy in that movie that one time?&rdquo; moments, IMDb is the place to look.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homepage offers interesting facts and videos/graphics of recent or older media. I tend to not go straight to the homepage as I usually get to this site through a Google search of a movie or actor. What really is the essential part of the home page is the search bar, and it is the first thing your eye catches. The search function is very effective, and will yield specific results. From farther back, your eye tends to be moved to the different videos and images screaming for attention lower down on the page.
            <br><br>
            5 adjectives to describe the  site visually: media rich, focused, informative,  alluring, inquisitive.
            <br><br>
            5 adjectives to describe content, focus and purpose: specific, thorough, related, extensive, complete.
            <br><br>
            Some adjectives to describe how I feel after some time on the site: satisfied (Gotta love getting that movie trivia factoid answered), entertained.
