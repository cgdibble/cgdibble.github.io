          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SQL injection is when SQL statements are inserted into a data field to be executed that are exploiting a security weakness and hoping to gain access to the database information. These vulnerabilities occur when situations such as the input data field not being filtered escape characters that exit string literals. This essentially allows a user (or in this case, a hacker) to access the database through data input fields. This means that someone can copy the database or even delete everything, or both! You can imagine that if a bank&#39;s website allowed this to happen, then someone could use SQL commands to access your information with out even having to login as you. That sounds pretty problematic, but luckily this is (hopefully) checked for and fixed.
          <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid this, developers need to use input validation to check against pre-defined rules for the input type, such as length, type and syntax.  You also want to make sure that any user input data is not sent to the SQL interpreter as a SQL query, as this allows commands to be sent directly through data fields. Input validation prevents commands from being passed this way, and limiting the user permissions as much as possible is always a good idea.  When it comes to web applications, it is not recommended to use system administrator accounts, as this would have full, or much more significant privileges when it comes to the database access.
